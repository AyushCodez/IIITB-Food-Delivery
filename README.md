There are 3 executable files that we have customer_UI.c, restowner_UI.c, and delivery_UI.c that allow you to login and use functionality of each aspect of food delivery respectively. These import there functions from other parts of the files

We are using a make file to create the 3 executable files from individual c codes.
To use the MakeFile you can run the commands "make customer", "make restowner", "make delivery" to create the executables customer,restowner and delivery respectively.
